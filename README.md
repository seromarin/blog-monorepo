Back and multiple fronts in a folder project

Based on tutorial: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-build-a-blog-with-nest-js-mongodb-and-vue-js
and with extra help: https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/authentication

I changed a few thing and the web app have a basic functionality. The web app has not many things but my basic idea was undestand Nest.js as a framework, how to use MongoDB with it and make a basic front with Vuejs.

## Intructions

1. Create a MongoDB to use
2. Change the 'MONGO_URI' in the backend project
3. Run backend
4. Run frontend
